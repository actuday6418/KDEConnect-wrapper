# KDEConnect-wrapper
A slim bash script that wraps around kdeconnect-cli to simplify sharing files to other devices from the comfort of the terminal

# Usage 
1. ```mv send_file.sh ~/.configs/scripts/send_file.sh```
2. Use the script wherever you'd like to (Polybar for me)
3. OR add ```alias share ~/.configs/scripts/send_file.sh''' to your .bashrc
